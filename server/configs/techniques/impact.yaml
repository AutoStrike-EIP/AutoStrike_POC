  name: Data Destruction
  description: |-
    Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.[1](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-attacks)[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126065851/https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/11/fireeye_respondsto.html)[3](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/)[4](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180722/Report_Shamoon_StoneDrill_final.pdf)[5](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/shamoon-3-targets-oil-gas-organization/)[6](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html) Common operating system file deletion commands such as <code>del</code> and <code>rm</code> often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.

    Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable.[4](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180722/Report_Shamoon_StoneDrill_final.pdf)[5](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/shamoon-3-targets-oil-gas-organization/) In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126065851/https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/11/fireeye_respondsto.html)[3](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/)[4](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180722/Report_Shamoon_StoneDrill_final.pdf)

    To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).[1](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-attacks)[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126065851/https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/11/fireeye_respondsto.html)[3](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/)[4](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180722/Report_Shamoon_StoneDrill_final.pdf)[6](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html).

    In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage access to delete cloud storage objects, machine images, database instances, and other infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.[7](https://threatpost.com/hacker-puts-hosting-service-code-spaces-out-of-business/106761/)[8](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/san-jose-man-pleads-guilty-damaging-cisco-s-network) Similarly, they may delete virtual machines from on-prem virtualized environments.

  name: Data Encrypted for Impact
  description: "Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.[1](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A)[2](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/wannacry-malware-profile.html)[3](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A)[4](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/AA18-337A)\n\nIn the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted (and often renamed and/or tagged with specific file markers). Adversaries may need to first employ other behaviors, such as [File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222) or [System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529), in order to unlock and/or gain access to manipulate these files.[5](https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/tau-threat-discovery-conti-ransomware/) In some cases, adversaries may encrypt critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.[3](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A) Adversaries may also encrypt virtual machines hosted on ESXi or other hypervisors.[6](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/hypervisor-jackpotting-ecrime-actors-increase-targeting-of-esxi-servers/) \n\nTo maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other attack techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).[2](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/wannacry-malware-profile.html)[3](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A) Encryption malware may also leverage [Internal Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001), such as changing victim wallpapers or ESXi server login messages, or otherwise intimidate victims by sending ransom notes or other messages to connected printers (known as \"print bombing\").[7](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2020/cc-3681#summary)[8](https://www.varonis.com/blog/vmware-esxi-in-the-line-of-ransomware-fire)\n\nIn cloud environments, storage objects within compromised accounts may also be encrypted.[9](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/s3-ransomware-part-1-attack-vector/) For example, in AWS environments, adversaries may leverage services such as AWS’s Server-Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C) to encrypt data.[10](https://www.halcyon.ai/blog/abusing-aws-native-services-ransomware-encrypting-s3-buckets-with-sse-c)"

Adversaries may stop services or processes in order to conduct [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485) or [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486) on the data stores of services like Exchange and SQL Server, or on virtual machines hosted on ESXi infrastructure.[3](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wcry-ransomware-analysis)[4](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/hypervisor-jackpotting-ecrime-actors-increase-targeting-of-esxi-servers/)\n\nThreat actors may also disable or stop service in cloud environments. For example, by leveraging the `DisableAPIServiceAccess` API in AWS, a threat actor may prevent the service from creating service-linked roles on new accounts in the AWS Organization.[5](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/tales-from-the-cloud-trenches-the-attacker-doth-persist-too-much/)[6](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DisableAWSServiceAccess.html)"

  description: |-
    Adversaries may delete or remove built-in data and turn off services designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted system to prevent recovery.[1](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html)[2](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/wannacry-malware-profile.html) This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.

    Operating systems may contain features that can help fix corrupted systems, such as a backup catalog, volume shadow copies, and automatic repair features. Adversaries may disable or delete system recovery features to augment the effects of [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485) and [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486).[1](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html)[2](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/wannacry-malware-profile.html) Furthermore, adversaries may disable recovery notifications, then corrupt backups.[3](https://x.com/TheDFIRReport/status/1498657590259109894)

    A number of native Windows utilities have been used by adversaries to disable or delete system recovery features:

    * <code>vssadmin.exe</code> can be used to delete all volume shadow copies on a system - <code>vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet</code>
    * [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) can be used to delete volume shadow copies - <code>wmic shadowcopy delete</code>
    * <code>wbadmin.exe</code> can be used to delete the Windows Backup Catalog - <code>wbadmin.exe delete catalog -quiet</code>
    * <code>bcdedit.exe</code> can be used to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration data - <code>bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no</code>
    * <code>REAgentC.exe</code> can be used to disable Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) repair/recovery options of an infected system
    * <code>diskshadow.exe</code> can be used to delete all volume shadow copies on a system - <code>diskshadow delete shadows all</code> [4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow) [5](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/technical-analysis-crytox-ransomware)

    On network devices, adversaries may leverage [Disk Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561) to delete backup firmware images and reformat the file system, then [System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529) to reload the device. Together this activity may leave network devices completely inoperable and inhibit recovery operations.

    On ESXi servers, adversaries may delete or encrypt snapshots of virtual machines to support [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486), preventing them from being leveraged as backups (e.g., via ` vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.removeall`).[6](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs.-blackcat-ransomware)

    Adversaries may also delete “online” backups that are connected to their network – whether via network storage media or through folders that sync to cloud services.[7](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-victims-thought-their-backups-were-safe-they-were-wrong/) In cloud environments, adversaries may disable versioning and backup policies and delete snapshots, database backups, machine images, and prior versions of objects designed to be used in disaster recovery scenarios.[8](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/code-hosting-service-shuts-down-after-cyber-attack)[9](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/s3-ransomware-part-2-prevention-and-defense/)

    In Windows, [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) utility, <code>Set-LocalUser</code> and <code>Set-ADAccountPassword</code> [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) cmdlets may be used by adversaries to modify user accounts. Accounts could also be disabled by Group Policy. In Linux, the <code>passwd</code> utility may be used to change passwords. On ESXi servers, accounts can be removed or modified via esxcli (`system account set`, `system account remove`).

    Adversaries who use ransomware or similar attacks may first perform this and other Impact behaviors, such as [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485) and [Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491), in order to impede incident response/recovery before completing the [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486) objective.
